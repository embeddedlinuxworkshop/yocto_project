### VSOMEIP Layer Requirements:

1. **VSOMEIP Layer:**
    - **Purpose:** Integrate the VSOMEIP middleware into the Yocto Project.
    - **Source Code:** Obtain the VSOMEIP library source code.
    - **Recipe:** Create a Yocto recipe for VSOMEIP with metadata, sources, dependencies, compilation, and installation instructions.
    - **Configuration:** Configure VSOMEIP for your project requirements within the layer.

### Libraries Layer Requirements:

2. **Libraries Layer:**
    - **Purpose:** Manage additional libraries required for your project.
    - **Dependencies:** Identify and list any external libraries required by your project.
    - **Recipes:** Create Yocto recipes for each library with appropriate metadata, sources, dependencies, compilation, and installation instructions.
    - **Integration:** Ensure that libraries are seamlessly integrated into the Yocto build system.
    - **Configuration:** Configure libraries as needed to align with the project requirements.

### Common Requirements:

3. **Yocto Environment:**
    
    - **Yocto Project Source Code:** Download the Yocto Project source code.
    - **Dependencies:** Install necessary dependencies, including Git, Python, and development tools.
    - **Build Directory:** Set up a build directory using the `oe-init-build-env` script.
4. **Layer Configuration:**
    
    - **Edit Configuration Files:** Modify `local.conf` and `bblayers.conf` to include the VSOMEIP Layer, the Libraries Layer, and any other relevant layers.
5. **Development Environment:**
    
    - **Linux Development Machine:** Use a Linux machine for Yocto development.
6. **Testing:**
    
    - **Target Hardware:** Have the target hardware ready for testing the Yocto-generated image.
    - **Validation:** Test the integrated VSOMEIP middleware and libraries on the target hardware.

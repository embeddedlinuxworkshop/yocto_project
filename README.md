Layer 1: meta-custom1

Create a directory structure for the layer.
Implement a layer.conf file inside the conf subdirectory.
Include a recipe in the recipes-example directory, e.g., example-recipe.bb.


Layer 2: meta-custom2

Create a directory structure for the second layer.
Implement a layer.conf file inside the conf subdirectory.
Include a recipe in the recipes-dependent directory, e.g., dependent-recipe.bb, with a dependency on a recipe from meta-custom1.
Dependency Between Layers

Ensure that the second layer (meta-custom2) has a recipe (dependent-recipe.bb) that explicitly depends on a recipe from the first layer (meta-custom1), creating a layer dependency.
Build Process

Configure the Yocto build environment to source both layers.
Use Yocto build commands (e.g., bitbake) to build the desired image, considering the dependencies between recipes and layers.
